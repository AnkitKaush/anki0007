Again what do you want... excuse me.. who talks to customers like this ??
I asked for his name to put a review and he flat out denied. I asked for receipt before handing my credit card. He swipes it and returns back my card. I m waiting for a receipt with my family in the car. He starts inputing another order on his tablet. Waited for sometime and then I waive my hand several times.

When I finally get the correct order, it is generally tasty. I'm a picky eater, and have found ways to navigate the menu to get items I like. Worked in the service industry for years as a server, bartender, and trainer. Taking and fulfilling orders is NOT hard, tedious at times though. I only go here when I see they are not busy, in hope that my order is correct when I go to leave. In the 10 times that I have been here in the past past year, I have only had 1 order that was perfectly correct. Just ONE, not an exaggeration. That one order was just 2 large fries and nothing else. Though I will mention that when I got home and pulled them out of the bag, they were hardly what you'd call filled, (nor did I enjoy any on the 3 minute drive home) so little so that I even sent a picture and post to McDonald's on Facebook, at least the few were hot. The evening staff is very pleasant, but the morning staff leaves a lot to be desired, as well as thinking that they can talk negatively about people in Spanish out in the open which, being a light skinned Puerto Rican, I understand perfectly.

Closed?! It's 24-hrs! And I get it, sometimes 24-hr places will close one night every several months to do a deep cleaning. I get that, I really do. But they ALWAYS post signs and notices so you're not blind-sided by it. Not this place. I really don't think they were closed. I think the workers were too lazy to do their job and decided to shut the store down so they could get paid to do nothing.
Additionally, this store has a bad habit of having a ""broken"" ice cream machine past 10pm. It's always ""sorry, ice cream machine is broken"" if you come in after the lobby closes.
The worst part is I complained on the website. I submitted a complaint for this store, pointing out the 24-hr and the ice cream issue. All I got back (weeks later) was ""oh, sorry the ice cream machine was broken, we're working to upgrade all our locations but it takes time"" Not even a single MENTION of the ""closed"" 24-hr location.

Not to mention, they are ALWAYS out of at least one item I order, and the drive-thru involves pulling off and waiting for 10-15 minutes every single time, even if there is no one in the place. Complete and utter disgrace.",1 star

The streamlined way allows serving just the drive up and so, the kitchen staff cooks food for just one area. Probably saves on staff hours.

There is a marked improvement in the service and cleanliness at this location on Ft. Hamilton Parkway. Katherine, the Manager, and her staff (Chris) promptly offered help and solutions to my family's needs. The use of a dedicated staff member to continuously clean the dining area was a big plus. I only feel that the beverage station should be closer to the dining area to facilitate the transfer of drinks from station to table; particularly for the disabled.
Another, concern was the price of the food. Though there were ""dollar"" options available, the price of the more popular sizes and items was very high. A median-income family of four would be wary of dining more than once a month, if that often.
The name of the counter person that helped us during our visit was Chris. He is a credit to the McDonalds company.",4 stars

However, there was no one waiting at the counter. I told the manager that the lady who prepared my order saw my order tag on the counter. Then, the manager changed his explanation. He said that after 7 PM, they don't serve table service. In other words, they don't bring order to the table after 7 PM. I said that the Mcdonald's app says that the table order is still available.

I have been coming here for years, and I put up with alot of inconveniences! Non the less, last night was appalling!! What's wrong with the girl cashier tan skin, black hair, the Hispanic or Indian girl with the yellow long press on nails?! Im sure you can single her out of the crowd. I wont say her name even though they all kept saying eachothers names out loud like it was high school musical back there. Is it mandatory for her to not give me my receipt? I , like many other hardworking Americans who have been coming here for as long as we all can remember, need a receipt; especially just incase how fast food workers forget to give us all of our order.. and wouldn't you know it, not only did they fail to give me my receipt, but they failed to give me the correct order. I asked for my order more than three times! Is it also part of the owner's of McDonald's policy to berate the customer in Spanish? I'm Puerto Rican and I understand everything they was saying. How rude to have said all of that in front of the customer, and about the customer. Is this how you value your rewards members? I'm going to post about my experience on any social media platform! Mark my words! I would also like to state that the woman manager allowed her staff to keep acting maliciously and she acted as if nothing was going wrong. Is this how you run your establishment?!
The African American fellow, tall, with a kind of lisp, gave me again the wrong order and the wrong receipt. Must be nice to pick out the garbage a receipt from three hours ago to give to me, thinking i wouldnt know the difference! The owner should pop on in!! Must Like losing out on money.

We try and avoid this place even when we specifically have a hankering for McDonald's. We always have an issue at this McDonald's no matter what time of day, whether we order from a food delivery service or in person. The orders always get screwed up, from missing items to getting a sausage egg and cheese mcgriddle that just had cheese! If there was other fast food options besides pizza and halal nearby we'd probably never go here again.
But today I finally understood why it's a mess: there's no communication. It was a busy time since school had just let out and I stood for about 5 minutes waiting for a Dr. Pepper and watched the crew work in relative silence while pushing out food orders without tickets and without speaking to each other. Anyone who has worked in food service knows a quiet kitchen spells more trouble than a loud one. Eventually my sister flagged down the man doing drink orders and asked if the drink he'd just placed in the row of 8 other drinks he'd been setting down indiscriminately was our Dr. Pepper and he said yes...it was a Coke.
Management here really needs to have a talk to the crew about working together as a team and communication, especially when it's busy. Yes it's just a McDonald's, and I'm not expecting white glove service from a fast food joint, but our community deserves better than what we're getting for sure.",2 stars

Never thought I'd be writing a review for a McDonald's, yet here we are. Was disappointed to hear that the purple packaging isn't available in the U.S. (@Corporate: missed opportunity!). Hesitant because the paper bag adorned with the BTS logo was not guaranteed to be available at all locations. Fears were quelled, as I saw other guests sitting outside, and the elusive BTS paper bag going for 70 on eBay was elusive no longer. Utilized the self-service machines to order - quick and easy. Medium and large sizes available (opted for medium, which was more than enough food in hindsight). Liked the Cajun sauce more than the Sweet Chili sauce, but just a personal preference. Total of the medium BTS meal was 8.39 0.74 tax 9.13. Food was nothing special; just happy to support the boys.

#3 there is no where in the store an area where you can grab napkins, or ketchup, or straws.

One young man seemed to be doing all the work involving the food. While they left a inexperienced young lad on the register. She told me my daughter could not have a Dr. Pepper cause it was not a drink choice for the cheeseburger meal. This sounded absurd so when I asked her to explain this she told me no we are just out of it. She was supper sweet and at this point I came to realize only her and the other young man were the only 2 working. As the manager sat there holding a mop and did literally nothing for 20 min.

Their chili burger is their traditional specialty. It has meat, chili, tomato, onions, and pickle. The chili seems greasy but I love it.
Tommy's is an acquired taste. I've been going to the original tommys since 1968 in Los Angeles at Beverly and rampart. That shack is open twenty-four hours a day, and you basically eat outside, putting your food on a ledge and standing to eat it.
This Tommy's is a more traditional restaurant, where are you give your order inside, pick it up and sit down in comfort.
I love that the fries are large because they hold the heat much longer than small fries.
I used to order extra chili with my hamburger, and it made things very messy. What I learned at this visit was to have the chili put on the side, so I could add it as I wanted.
there are many different types and flavors to chili. This was brought home to me one time when I was at the original Tommy's and picked up my burger and drink right after a couple. They ended up eating nearby, and I heard the mail of the couple exclaim, ""That's not good chili!""
I was wondering what part of the Southwest he was from because of his critique. I just about choked on my drink when I heard him say, ""If you want good chili, you need to come to New York!""
I'm sure that there are good places to get chili in New York, but that guy was probably one of the people that considers everything west of the Hudson River to be a dining desert.",5 stars

I got my order and walked upstairs to the first level and sat at a comfortable booth. Within a few minutes a manager came to my table to ask if everything was OK, and I told him ""Yes"", but I was having trouble to connect to the free WiFi. He immediately helped me with this and although the connection was slow, I was pleased that the problem was solved.
Then the manager chatted with me and asked if I would mind doing a survey and I filled out the online survey. Then he said I was entitled to a free burger so I had a Big Mac.

This McDonalds located at 262 Canal Street, in Chinatown, New York City have been here for ages.
All McDonalds are created equal in terms of cleanliness, so it is no surprise that it is very clean, neat, tidy and spotlessly clean.
It is a huge McDonalds because it has 3 stories, but on the second and third floor, there is a limited number of chairs. Poor design left it with about 40 to 50 seats on the 2 top floors.
The staff is very professional, friendly and polite with a smile, and there are staff who are bilingual {English and Chinese) (English and Spanish).
Enjoy Mickey Ds and
A Happy Thanksgiving.",4 stars

A couple of years ago they modified the interior- they removed a lot of seats on the main floor in order to install electronic order kiosks. There are now only a handful of places to sit in a ridiculously cramped manner. Late at night they close the upstairs- leaving pretty much nowhere decent to sit and eat. Tonight I saw two people eating over the garbage cans and one eating by the soda dispenser.
The kiosks are annoying. They ask if you want to take out or eat there. If you select ""Eat In"", before you can pay for your order you're asked to get a table marker and enter the marker number. Thing is there are absolutely no table markers- you cannot complete your order without one- unless you start over and select ""take out"".

The 2 hamburgers I ordered were cold , COLD . Worse, they did not contain the extra pickles I requested 3 times! Yes 3 x. The 2 Apple pies were not only cold ...but ,worse, had been clearly sitting out all day and were so over cooked, I just spit them out and into the garbage; less than 1 bite.
The chicken sandwich was not hot either and worse , it was waaaay overly smeared with unhealthy mayo which I threw away so as to not suffer food poisoning. It was by far the worst fast food restaurant experience ever in my life and it cost me a whopping 9 dollars and 93 cents. I WANT A REFUND PLEASE.
FINALLY ,this crowded McDonald's was the filthiest and dirtiest one I've ever been in.
So very very sad and disappointed.

Waiting time was less than 5 minutes. Good fast food spot for a quick bite to eat! They also offer order yourself service and of course on the app too! Food was good. The only reason I couldn't give this McDonald's a 5 stars was because many tables and chairs to eat in were a bit dirty.

1st...this Mc Donald's seemed to have their own guidlines for COVID-19. And the guidlines they followed were NONE or ZERO. The place was VERY crowded.NO social distancing. NO one to monitor or count how many people were allowed in. it did not feel or look clean or a safe environment ...good to spread germs and viruses.
alot of people from the street who were not customers just hanging around using many tables and shoulder to shoulder in the seats. people passed out in the chairs with masks pulled off. They had ONE dining room person who just could not keep up with the mess that they were leaving. The bathroom was a horror show: obviously people were washing and cleaning more than just their hands inside. was dirty.
2nd,..the saving grace of the restaurant was the cashier, the food expediter and the employees making the food. they were all very fast, pleasant, thanked me, and the food was hot, fresh and very good.
Dining area and bathroom: 0 (zero) stars
Behind the counter employees and food: 4 stars

As mentioned in other reviews here, there is a problem with the overall cleanliness of the restaurant and the ""transients"" that call the place ""home"".
I'm not sure if there is a homeless shelter nearby or if people just love to hang out in the place, but there are always less fortunate people there especially in the morning. Just this morning I've witnessed the NYPD escort a woman out of the restaurant that was loitering. There are signs throughout the restaurant that clearly state No Loitering and that there is a 30 min time limit. Now that the weather is getting colder, people are just looking to stay warm.
Unfortunately, McDonalds is in a difficult position. As a former General Manager of a fast food restaurant, I used to deal with ""rough"" teenagers and ""undesirables"" especially at night. I wanted my paying customers to have a friendly, warm and inviting environment to eat in with their families. The ""rough"" crowd made that very difficult to maintain. I, like McDs started with signs. The McDs in this review also has full time security to help keep the people safe and moving.
You see, you just can't stand at the door and not allow people to come into McDs. The best you can do is try to manage it. I give them a lot of credit for trying to do just that. I also give credit to the employees as they have to deal with it all day long. As far as the cleanliness, they can do a much better job there. I can't speak for all the people given Lobby Duty, but I've never seen one with a cleaning bottle and rag to clean the tables. So, even I had to sit at a table this morning that wasn't clean. It wasn't exactly disgusting, but it wasn't clean either.
I've never been in the bathrooms because I try to avoid them at all costs. I've seen the people that come out of there and also the bathrooms at Penn Station down the block. It can't be pleasant in there and frankly, I wouldn't want to clean it either.
There are other McDs in the area, but this one is at times convenient for me. You can't beat the price for breakfast in that area in NYC. I would NEVER bring my family there. But for a quick stop in the morning, it's ok.
So, the 3 stars are just for the environment, the ""ambiance"" and the cleanliness. The food and the staff are great, it's just a ""difficult"" place to eat in given the community.",3 stars

I have had them give me 3 dr peppers in one drive thru order just to end up with something that clearly was NOT a regular one!!! In addition to having the attitudes checked from those that gave me BIG ATTITUDE for being so, I guess ""insistent that this was not regular dr pepper, I would also examine the machines when they run low or tell the employees not to outright LIE about giving me regular dr pepper just to keep 1.40 - which btw, I'm curious as to why I was charged 1.41 for a large at this location when I'm ALWAYS charged 1.40 at the one on mathilda!!!????",2 stars

Arguing with a customer is not a good idea it would have been a better idea if she would have said I'm going to let it go this time but no they actually try to argue the point and I think that's silly the whole reason that I come there at all is because of the 1 coffee that is fairly good on a one to 10 scale I would say McDonald's coffee is it seven or eight with Starbucks being a 10 especially when they suggest you get the expresso shot that is 4.25 for the large coffee with the extra espresso shot from Starbucks and then there's creamer but that for dollar coffee is four times better than McDonald's one dollar coffee so you get what you pay for I just think McDonald's at that particular Stevens Creek location bites off customers,1 star

Numerous times we get home after a visit to McDonald's and notice the forgot to include apple slices, or apple juice. I agree these are smaller items and do not effect the price much, however, when you have kids waiting for their orders get very upset and get angry n hurt that these things are missing. It is very upsetting! Also, we tend to order a lot of unsweetened ice teas. 8 out of 10 times the tea tastes disgusting!! It is old tea or the bag doesn't get changed when the make more. I get so mad that no one seems to care enough to be sure every shift cares to do their job correctly to ensure a high quality in ALL their products. I have brought these concerns to numerous managers and employees but never get satisfaction that they care and fix the issue!! It may be ok for a week but happens again or on a different shift. All emplyees should care enough about their jobs and themselves to do the best they can in all areas of a job performance!!! Please do your best to inform this McDonald's of these issues and have them retrain and fix these issues. My sanity and their job performances depend on this!!! Thank You!!",3 stars

Not to mention she looked super unprofessional.
Super rude service at speaker and worse at the window.
She realized I was upset over the terrible service and has the audacity to say you having a bad day?
I really tried not to argue and fight over some ignorant person being miserable over their job getting paid 10 so I said
Im great
I ask for the price because she never told me it and she sucked her teeth rolled and her eyes at me and told me it.
And then charged me.
She was giving me this nasty death stare like I l cause I used to work for McDonalds. Every quarter meat is cooked to order, the McDonalds was empty",1 star

And this was after I had to go BACK through the drive through a second time because my son's happy meal was missing the fries. I mean isn't there a screen that shows what should go in the bags before handing to the customer? And after the second time through I got home to that trash sandwich and they also forgot the sauce for the nuggets, even through I saw it on my receipt so they knew I wanted it, and hot cakes without butter. Just carelessness on all fronts at this location. Oh and when I got to the pick-up window I told the woman I have a boy so please put a boy toy in the happy meal, and she said all of our toys are unisex.

I show up everyday at 2:45 am and sometimes i can get a qtr pounder and other days they say it's not on the late night menu. What really bugs me is that several time I am told breakfast only! No ody shows up at that time for a mcgriddle. Stop being lazy and make the food. Most of the breakfast is ready to slap together and is why they do it, but i show up before 3 am and I want a burger!

Also, the McDonald's app has great deals. If you do the survey on the recite than you get a buy one get one free discount.
Since I have frequented McDonald's for a long time, I must admit that I have mixed sentiments regarding the eatery. On the one side, the meal is typically pretty decent, and I like the quick and convenient service. However, there are some problems that I've come to realize over time that make me feel like the experience isn't as positive as it once was.
The rising costs of the products on the menu are one of my main worries. Every time I visit McDonald's, it seems like the costs have increased once again. This makes it challenging to continue frequenting them as much as I once did, especially with the availability of more economical fast food alternatives.
Another problem is that McDonald's used to give frequent and significant discounts and promotions, but lately they seem to be less frequent and generous. This is disappointing because I've always valued the ability to occasionally save a few dollars on my lunch.
Having said that, there are still a few aspects of McDonald's that I genuinely value. The majority of the cuisine is delicious and good, and the quickness of service is still unmatched. The restaurant is always spotless and well-kept, making it a perfect choice if you need a fast dinner on the run. Overall, I would say that McDonald's is still a good option for fast food, but because of the rising costs and less promotions, it has lost its place as my top pick. However, a typical McDonald's burger and fries are a great choice if you're searching for a quick and delectable dinner.",4 stars

This location always has homeless people standing/sitting at each exit of the parking lot.

I was stopped by one homeless man and he asked for money, and usually I don't carry cash, but I happened to have a couple quarters in my car, so I gave them to him and he thanked me for helping him and his brother out. I pulled forward a bit more, and his brother stood up, walked over to my car, and I thought he was just going to thank me for the money, but nope! He literally started climbing inside my car to get some food from the passenger seat. He was grabbing me, and had his hands on my steering wheel and I started driving away to get him to stop after offering him some more quarters so he could buy his own food, and he kept yelling at me saying that he wanted the food I had.

I have had customer service issues with this McDs franchise before and have taken issues to the managers.Tonight I became livid!
I
parked my rented scooter along the side of the building, like Ive done for the last year with no problem.Tonight, a large black security guard got out of his car and yelled across the lot that I couldnreep moving on (he had gone inside by this time.)It was not the words, though gruffly spat, but his tone and his pompous, condescending attitude towards me.
I continued to the front, parked the scooter AGAIN, and went straight to the manager to vent my complaint about the treatment I had received.Initially, the complaint was well and openly received by a young, demur manager on duty, and she apologized for the treatment.I also explained that I lived in the area, frequented this McDs, and that I would rather inconvenience myself and go an additional mile and a half to Burger King than spend one dime at this McDive change in their employees, or the District/Corporate Big-Wigs are allowing this to happen.The lack of customer service and concern is appalling---especially for a name like McDonalds!I stormed out and left in disgust!

But honestly this place is really sketch, they even have a security guard at the front door in case things go sideways. If you are wondering HOW things could go sideways, you wouldn't have to expand your view further then the amount of druggys that go to this McDonalds. Half of them don't even buy anything, they just stand around (to heat up I presume) waiting for the security to kick them out. The other half stand in line and figure out that they can't buy anything at the front desk then leave. Normally I wouldn't have a problem with this if they kept to themselves like everyone else ordering something at the McDonald's, but they would randomly yell, ask questions, pan handle, and just were being a general nuisance. I understand that an establishment can't control who their costumers are, so it's not exactly the MD's fault, but still this Micky D's should be avoided at all costs for that reason. I give them 2 stars instead of one because the good customer service and magically clean bathroom. Seriously these cashiers have to deal with a lot of weird stuff and they somehow aren't mentally broken by the end of the day. I went at 11 at night which probably affects my review, but from the first impression I'm not inclined to go again to find out how it is in the day unless it was simultaneously the only restaurant, I was starving more than a communist in the gulag, and I lost my ability to cook food myself.

For those idiots that are crying about their car getting booted, they were obviously trying to take advantage - even if they were McDonald's customers. There's signs posted all over that are plain as day stating 30 minute parking only otherwise subject to getting booted or towed. the sign also blatantly says DO NOT LEAVE THESE PREMISES WITHOUT YOUR VEHICLE. so for everyone else crying, try reading the freaking sign. You know those metal signs cost money and they weren't custom made for entertainment or cosmetic purposes. use your brains......

Wiping the sweat from my brow, I tried to recall the details. ""Table service at MacDonald's"" I heard my self say aloud. I picked up my phone to find my dream a reality: MacDonald's had implemented technology allowing them to bring my order to me at the table. I could order on the kiosk, take a locator, and lo and behold, my order would appear before my very eyes. It was as if God himself had given me a glimpse of creation.
I sprung from my abode and ran on all fours to MacDonald's as quickly as possible, as if reality itself would evaporate before I got there. I arrived, breath short and mouth whet, and began the final steps of my journey. My finger met the kiosk screen like lovers separated by the ocean reuniting.
I got my usual, a cheeseburger with no bun or patty, and sat patiently, gripping my locator like the staff of Moses. The number seven sat abreast my locator -- the day God rested. ""I too would rest,"" I exclaimed aloud, ""when my journey meets it's end, as my food meets my table.""
But in the next instant, I was met with a fate worse than Gob's a thousand fold -- they called out my order from the counter and didn't bring it out to me.

Dining room was small, seemed clean (my order was to-go so didn't spend much time inside).
Loved the digital menu/self-order kiosks (ordered at the kiosk and it still gave the option to pay cash at the register, though not sure if that option's still available and/or if the dining room's even open right now...?).
Staff was friendly enough and very helpful, packed my to-go order like absolute pros.
The area where the fountain drinks, straws, etc., are wasn't super tidy (a bit of a spill on the countertop, if memory serves); however, seemed clean, otherwise.
Because it was such a quick trip, didn't get to see the condition of the bathrooms (a good indicator of an establishment's working and overall conditions, in my experience). Maybe another time?
Overall, a good experience.
Something to consider: there's no drive-through nor a parking lot and finding a parking space seems to be a nightmare/hit-or-miss in that area. Circled the surrounding blocks a few times before someone parked almost right in front of the store just happened to be leaving (not sure how often that happens, though). Score!
The previous parking spot I'd found was about 2 blocks away (doable), but kept searching in order to be closer to the other establishment my group and I were visiting prior to McD's.",4 stars

There was a ""deal"" available through the McD's app that was a great value & fit what I enjoy at McD's (occaisionally). Everything processed for the order... once I succeeded in completing the order with small amount of difficulty. Checked my account two days later as part of semi-weekly review. The McD's mobile ordering double charged me for the order. They processed two charges for the one order. When rhe corporate McD's was contacted they apologized, stated the program has occasional quirks (being worked out), and told me I needed to drive out of my way to go back to the store to get my money back. After explaining that they would have to reimburse my time and expenses to do their legwork in correcting their error of stealing my money AND explaining that they simply review their detail processing report of electronic charges for the two transactions (I provided the actual transaction info for date, time, #'s etc) they agreed to process the charge reversal.... because they WOULD NOT reimburse my time/expenses to return to get my refund of money they stole out of my account. After considerable time and insistence on my part, the manager agreed and reviewed the transactions report, verified the double billing, and assured the charge will be reversed. I got a follow up call from the area manager for McD's who turned out to be VERY unprofessional and rude in her attitude and handling if the matter. She actually admitted she hung up on me when I was reprimanding her on her shortcomings for not listening to what I was saying and continually speaking loudly over me, while I was speaking. Interesting..... is this how McD's is improving the bottom line, by stealing? NO ONE at McD's, even after explaining the process to correct an improper charge, had a clue how to address or willingness to pursue. They directly stated it was on me. I had to come back to a store, out of my way, to get a refund of my money, that they improperly seized from my account. Unbelievable as that is for my 1st mobile order/purchase experience w/McD's they were excited I used it and recommended I try the mobile order system again soon. Yeah right..... I'm gonna use a system with a 100% failure rate (my experience) and that they have no knowledge of how to process system failures, that do occur to their admission & knowledge. Horrible experience in all regards. Clearly rolled out the program with known links and poor or no training in corrective measures when incurred.",1 star

The problem I faced recently was a homeless person who walked up to me and asked for 2 dollars for bus fare. When the bus stop is like 2 to three blocks down the road. I said I will buy you something to eat or drink but not give money. So, for folks or tourists who get folks coming to them asking for money I suggest trying to offer food to them is more important then money. One thing about DC is there is alot of resources for folks who need money for bus fare or anything can find. Food too they know where to go. It's up to them to make that move. Another major situation I noticed is the McDonald's need some updating. I might know why they keep it so dull looking because McDonald's operates with the homeless so I guess they don't want to make it too comfortable. I been to much better ones who got nice and cool lounge chairs couches and OMG this one just looks ragged.",2 stars
